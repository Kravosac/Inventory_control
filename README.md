# Inventory_control
This algorithm simulates a working inventory and allows the user to register new products, add or remove quantities of a product and print reports.
The data is stored in the file 'inventory.txt', so please make sure that this file is in the same directory of the code archive.
This file has some initial data, which can me modified using the program.
Any issues report are very welcome!
Thanks and enjoy :-)
